## Description
```
An application to track your workouts and track progress made over time. I made this basic tracker to add what exercise you did, how may reps and at what weight with a jquery function and another function to add that data to a table for tracking.

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. header(.header)
.. targets header , ex( adds color, padding, text decoration and text aligment to the jumbotron header.)

2. section(.body)
targets body of the page (adds padding to create space between header and body)

3. .table(.section) targets the table(adds borders, padding and spacing to table.)

```


## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. $(function() {});
function trackIt(){
.. what function does: trackIt() is used to move the data from the input fields to the table.

```
