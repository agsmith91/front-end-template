## Description
```
An application to track your workouts and track progress made over time. I made this basic tracker to add what exercise you did, how may reps and at what weight with a jquery function and another function to add that data to a table for tracking.

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. paragraph(.body)
. targets h2. Adds padding, text and background color.

2. .mr-sm-2(.body)
targets selector field. Adds padding between selector and header.

3. .table(.section) targets the table(adds borders, padding and spacing to table.)

```


## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. $(function() {});
function trackIt(){
.. what function does: trackIt() is used to move the data from the input fields to the table.

```
